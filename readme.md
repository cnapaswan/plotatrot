# PLOTATROT 

  Travel planning helper for you and your group
  **launch it [here](https://plotatrot.herokuapp.com/)**

  the name Plotatrot was inspired from the word 'globetrotting' and the action of plotting when you plan trips. In the database, I named 'trot' to represent each place you list to go and all you have to do is 'plot' it, here we come 'PLOTATROT'! 

## using the app
  1. add the next destination city on the homepage to create the city card
  2. click on the city card, it leads to the template of 'go', 'eat', 'sleep'
  3. click into each of them to list your destination
  4. add each destination from the provided template at the bottom of the page
  5. the cards of every place you list will appear and allow your friends to comment on each one
